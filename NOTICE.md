## The CAD data is not ours

This repository contains **tooling only**. The field models it operates on
are the official RoboMaster University Championship (RMUC) and RoboMaster
University League (RMUL) arena CAD releases published by **DJI / RoboMaster**
for competition teams (`RMUC2026_V1.2.0.step`, `RMUC2026_V2.0.0.stp`,
`RMUL2026.stp`, `能量单元.stp` and the files derived from them). Those models,
their geometry, names, colours and structure are the intellectual property
of SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd. and its RoboMaster organising committee and
are provided by them under the RoboMaster competition rules and download
terms. Obtain them from the official RoboMaster website
(https://www.robomaster.com) and keep them under those terms.

Accordingly:

- **No STEP, IGES, glTF, XBF or mesh files of the DJI models are committed
  here**, and none should ever be. `.gitignore` blocks the common formats;
  split packages, sidecar indexes and mesh bundles are regenerated from the
  official files on demand.
- `out/` holds **derived metadata** (manifests and validation reports:
  entity ids, product names, face counts, bounding boxes, colour keys)
  computed from the DJI files. It is included so the proof in
  `docs/split-proof.md` can be checked without re-running the pipeline. It
  remains a derivative of DJI's models and is published for the same purpose
  the models are released for: building and simulating RoboMaster robots.
  Do not redistribute it outside that context.
- Product names, entity ids and numbers quoted in the documentation are
  likewise taken from DJI's files.

This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by or sponsored by DJI or
RoboMaster.
